# ICLR KiCad Hardware Libraries
This repository contains custom symbol, footprint and 3d model libraries for components that are not included in the default KiCad library.

## Using this library
The first step to using this library is to clone this repository using your git client of choice. Our recommendation is to make an ICLR somewhere on your computer where it is not backed up to onedrive - this is because some tools used in designing do not work when there is a whitespace in the path name!

### Environment variable


### Symbol library


### Footprint library


### 3D model library
Each KiCad footprint has a 3D model associated with it, which can be assigned in the footprint properties.
